Seared Salmon With Saffron Hollandaise Recipe | Sur La Table	Home /Recipes/Main Courses/Seafood/Seared Salmon With Saffron Hollandaise	By Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen	Yield: 4 servings	 Seared salmon:   4 (6-ounce) salmon fillets, pin bones removed Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon vegetable oil    Saffron hollandaise:  1/4 cup dry white wine 1/4 cup white wine vinegar 1 medium shallot, minced 1 teaspoon black peppercorns 1/8 teaspoon saffron threads steeped in 1 tablespoon warm water 3 large egg yolks 2 sticks (8 ounces) unsalted butter, melted  Sea salt  2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice, plus more as needed   1 tablespoon minced chives  	To prepare the salmon: Season fillets generously on both sides with salt and pepper. To a large nonstick skillet set over medium-high heat, add oil. When oil is shimmering, add the salmon fillets, flesh side down, and sear on both sides until nicely browned and the flesh is no longer translucent in the thickest part of the fillet, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Remove salmon from skillet and place on a large plate; tent with foil to keep warm while you prepare the sauce.   To prepare the sauce: In a small saucepan, combine wine, vinegar, shallots, and peppercorns; cook until nearly dry. You should have about 1 tablespoon of liquid. Cool the reduction to room temperature, then strain through a fine mesh sieve into a medium heatproof bowl and combine with the saffron water.   To prepare the egg mixture: To a medium saucepan, add water to reach 2 inches, and bring to a simmer. Add egg yolks to the bowl with the reduction and place the bowl over the simmering water, whisking constantly. To avoid overcooking the mixture, be sure that the water is barely simmering with no visible signs of surface action, just steam rising. As the egg yolks warm, they increase in volume. If they become too warm and begin to coagulate around the sides and bottom, remove from heat and cool slightly.  To prepare the hollandaise: When the yolks have tripled in volume and the mixture thickly coats the back of a spoon, after about 5 minutes, remove the bowl from the simmering water. Stabilize the bowl and begin adding the melted butter in a slow, thin stream, whisking constantly as it is incorporated. The sauce will begin to thicken as more butter is added. When the hollandaise is thick, velvety, and coats the back of a spoon, add the lemon juice and taste and adjust seasoning with salt and additional lemon juice as needed. If too thick, add a little warm water to thin the consistency.  If the sauce starts to break: It could be one of two things: either the butter was added too quickly, or the egg mixture got too hot (scrambled eggs). To rescue a broken sauce, try adding a small amount of boiling water and whisking until the sauce is smooth before adding more butter, or add another egg yolk to a clean bowl and set back over simmering water; whisk until thickened and using a fine mesh strainer to catch the scrambled egg, slowly strain the broken hollandaise gradually into the new egg yolk.  To serve: Place each salmon fillet on a warmed dinner plate and spoon hollandaise on top of each portion. Garnish with minced chives and serve immediately.	
Pan-Seared Scallops with Prosecco Butter Sauce Recipe | Sur La Table	Home /Recipes/Main Courses/Seafood/Pan-Seared Scallops with Prosecco Butter Sauce	By Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen	Makes 4 servings	  2 tablespoons canola or vegetable oil 1-½ pounds sea scallops, tough ligament removed from the side  Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon olive oil, if needed 1 small shallot, minced 1 medium garlic clove, minced 1 cup Prosecco  ¼ cup whipping cream 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces 1 tablespoon lemon juice 2 tablespoons chopped chives  	These succulent scallops are perfectly accompanied with sweet yet slightly acidic Prosecco in a delicate buttery sauce. For even cooking with a crisp exterior, it is suggested that the exterior of the scallops are patted dry prior to cooking, seasoned and allowed to reach room temperature before being placed into a hot pan.   Remove the scallops from the refrigerator and season with salt and pepper. Allow to reach room temperature.  To cook scallops: Place a large non-stick skillet over a high heat;  add canola oil and heat until the oil starts to shimmer. Carefully add the seasoned scallops to the skillet, sear until browned on both sides and just opaque in the center&#8212;about 2 to 3 minutes per side, depending on the size. Using tongs, transfer the scallops to a plate and tent with foil to keep warm.  To prepare the sauce: Return the skillet to the stove over a moderate heat, and add the olive oil if the pan is dry. When the oil is shimmering, add the shallots and cook until tender, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the Prosecco; bring the liquid to a boil and cook, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan with a silicone spatula. Pour in the cream and continue to cook until the mixture has thickened, about 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the butter a little at a time.  Stir in the lemon juice and chives, taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.   To serve: Divide the scallops between 4 warmed serving plates, ladle the sauce over the top and serve immediately.

This version includes infused garlic-rosemary oil, fried capers and a lemony arugula salad which adds nuance and flavor contrast to the classic perfectly grilled steak.  Rub the steak liberally with 2 tablespoons olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper. Allow steak to sit at room temperature for about thirty minutes before cooking.  To prepare the garlic-rosemary oil: Combine remaining &#8532;-cup olive oil and garlic in a small saucepan and place over low heat. Cook until garlic starts to turn brown around the edges, about 5 minutes. Add chopped rosemary and freshly ground black pepper, stirring to combine.  To fry the capers: Fill a small saucepan with a ½-inch of vegetable oil and heat over medium heat until the oil registers 325°F on a deep-fry thermometer. Using a slotted spoon, carefully add capers to hot oil and fry, stirring once, until they begin to open and turn golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove fried capers with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Set aside.   Preheat a grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. Place the steak on the grill and cook for 4 to 5 minutes. Using tongs, turn the steak and cook to medium-rare, or until a meat thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the steak registers 130°F, about 5 minutes more. (For steaks thicker than 1½ inches, transfer steak to a rack set over a rimmed baking sheet and roast in a preheated 400°F oven to finish cooking.) Transfer steak to a cutting board and allow it to rest for 5 minutes.  To serve: Arrange arugula over a large serving platter or plates. Using a carving knife, cut the steak across the grain into ¼-inch thick slices and arrange over the greens. Drizzle some of the warm garlic-rosemary oil and aged balsamic over (reserve the rest of the garlic oil for other uses). Scatter the fried capers and shaved parmesan over the top. Serve immediately with lemon wedges.

After all, what&#8217;s better than a day completely devoted to a delicious feast shared by family and friends, all giving thanks for their blessings? This recipe takes an American classic to celebration status with a careful blend of spices and heavy cream, outshining the stale spice mix and evaporated milk of less enchanting recipes. Ever notice how spices clump up and don&#8217;t blend well when added to a custard? The trick is to blend them first with the eggs, whose fat helps the clumps disperse evenly, before adding any liquid to the custard mixture. 	 <>b>To prepare the pie crust: remove the dough from the refrigerator about 15 minutes before you are ready to roll it to allow it to soften slightly. Generously flour a work surface and place chilled dough disk on the flour. Dust the top of the dough with flour. Using a rolling pin, roll chilled dough into a circle, turning and flipping the dough as needed with a bench scraper to prevent sticking, until the circle measures 14 inches wide and ⅛ inch thick. Starting at one edge, roll the dough around the rolling pin and lay it gently on top of a 9-inch glass or ceramic pie pan. Gently press the dough into the bottom and sides of the pan. Use a pair of kitchen scissors to trim the dough so it overhangs the edge of the pan by 1 inch. Fold the overhanging dough under itself around the pan edge, then crimp or form a decorative border. Chill the lined pan for at least 30 minutes.   Preheat oven to 375&#176F and place a rack in the bottom third.   Prepare the pie for blind baking: line the chilled pie shell with heavy-duty foil, pressing the foil firmly and smoothly into the crevices of the pan. Fill the pan with pie weights. Make sure the weights reach up the sides to the rim of the pan (the center does not need to be filled quite as full). Bake the shell for 20 to 22 minutes, until the foil comes away from the dough easily (if it doesn&#8217;t, then bake another 5 to 6 minutes and check again). Remove the pan from the oven, close the oven door, and lift out the foil and weights from the shell; set them aside to cool. Return the pan to the oven to continue baking the shell for about 10 minutes, then remove the pan from the oven, close the oven door, and check to see if any cracks have formed. If you see a crack, very gently smear a tiny bit of reserved dough over the crack to patch it&#8212;you need only enough to seal the opening. Return the pan to the oven and bake 10 to 15 minutes longer, until the crust is a nice golden brown all over. Transfer to a rack and cool slightly. Lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees.  While the pie crust is baking, make the filling: whisk the eggs in a large mixing bowl to break them up. Add cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, allspice and salt and whisk well to blend evenly. Whisk in the cream, brown sugar, granulated sugar and pumpkin and blend well. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer directly into the tart shell and bake until the custard is set, about 30 to 40 minutes. Test by tapping the side of the pie pan&#8212;the center of the pie should look firm and move as one piece. Transfer the pie to a rack and cool completely, about 2 hours.  Make the meringue: bring an inch of water to a boil in the bottom of the double boiler. Place the egg whites and sugar in the top of the double boiler off the heat. Set on top of the simmering water and whisk constantly (not vigorously, just enough to keep the whites moving) for 4 to 5 minutes, until the egg whites are hot to the touch and the mixture reaches 160-degrees on an instant read thermometer (the mixture should look frothy, but not whipped). Remove the whites from the heat each time you test their temperature. When they are on the heat, keep whisking to prevent scrambling. If that happens, there is no recourse and you will have to begin again, so watc

Truffle Garlic Mashed Potatoes Recipe | Sur La Table		By Katie Holler & Michael McConnell	Makes 6 to 8 servings	  3 lbs of unbruised russet potatoes, peeled and quartered 1 head of garlic (not dried out) 12 tbsp (about 6 oz.) of black truffle butter at room temperature 1 cup of cream or half and half  Olive oil Salt and freshly ground pepper 	<ol> Measure the cream or half and half and set aside to come to room temperature.  Cut the top off the garlic and set it in a square of foil large enough to envelop the garlic. Drizzle the garlic with olive oil, fold it up in the foil and roast it on a baking sheet in a 350° oven for about 40 minutes.  Toward the end of the roasting process, fill a large pot about &#190; full of water. Add 2 tsp salt and bring to the boil while you peel and quarter the potatoes.  Put the potatoes in the pot and pour off the excess water. (The water should just cover the potatoes). Cover the pot and cook 15&#8211;20 minutes until the potatoes are tender but not waterlogged.  Drain the potatoes and place in a large bowl with about half the butter. Give them the once-over with a potato masher or a ricer.  Unwrap the roasted garlic and squeeze the insides into a small bowl (remove any bits of the papery skin or other debris that may fall in). Add the garlic to the potatoes and mash or rice to your desired consistency.  Beat the cream into the potato mixture with a wooden spoon, adding a couple of tablespoons at a time.  (Note:  if the cream is still cold, take the chill off of it with a few seconds in the microwave.)  Add cracked pepper and salt to taste. A little additional cream is only a mistake if the potatoes are getting a bit watery, so feel free to add more as you like!  Put it all in a serving bowl and top with remaining black truffle butter.

If ball does not form, add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, and continue mixing until ball forms. Coat a large mixing bowl with a thin film of olive oil. Transfer dough ball to prepared mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rest until doubled in volume, about 1-½ to 2 hours.   Press dough gently to remove air bubbles, and turn out on a lightly floured work surface. Using a bench scraper, divide dough into 8 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a tight ball, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and allow dough to rest for 15 minutes.  Dust work surface with flour. Flatten one dough ball to a thickness of ½ inch, and roll to a diameter of about 5 inches, keeping the remaining dough covered.   Transfer dough rounds to a parchment paper-lined rimmed baking sheet and cover with another piece of parchment. Continue rolling dough balls and placing on the baking sheet, separating layers of rolled dough with additional sheets of parchment, as needed. Cover stack of dough rounds with plastic wrap and set aside until ready to bake.  	
Rich Breakfast Dough Recipe | Sur La Table	Home /Recipes/Breads/Dough/Rich Breakfast Dough	By The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing, recipes by Cindy Mushet, photography by Maren Caruso	Makes about 1½ pounds	  ½ cup (4 ounces) warm whole milk (110&deg; to 115&deg;F) ¼ cup (1&#190; ounces) sugar 1½ teaspoons active dry yeast, or 1⅛ teaspoons instant yeast 1 large egg plus 1 egg yolk, at room temperature 2½ cups (12½ ounces) bread flour or unbleached all-purpose flour ½ teaspoon salt 1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter, very soft (not melted)  	A leaner version of brioche dough, this can be used for all those wonderful, yeasted breakfast breads you love, like sticky buns and coffee cake. Classic brioche, while delicious, is unnecessarily rich when paired with flavor-packed fillings and toppings. Despite the reduced amount of eggs and butter, this dough is still soft and easy to work with, and it bakes into a tender, flavorful partner for all manner of fillings, both sweet and savory.  Mix and knead the dough: Combine the warm milk and sugar in the bowl of the stand mixer and sprinkle the yeast over the top. Whisk by hand to blend well. Let the mixture sit for 5 to 10 minutes, until the yeast is activated and foamy or bubbling. Add the egg and yolk and whisk by hand until well blended. Stir in the flour and salt with a silicone or rubber spatula. Attach the dough hook and knead on low speed for 2 minutes. The dough may look ragged at this point, but don't worry&#45;the addition of butter will smooth it out. Increase the speed to medium and knead for 1 minute. With the mixer running, add the soft butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, allowing each addition to blend in before adding the next. Once all the butter has been added, decrease the speed to medium-low and continue to knead for 5 to 6 minutes longer, until the dough looks soft and silky.  Rise the dough (first rise): Lightly butter or oil the tub or bowl, scrape the dough into the tub, and brush the surface of the dough with a little butter or oil. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp lint-free cotton towel and let the dough rise until doubled, 1 to 1½ hours. If you are using a tub, be sure to mark the starting level of the dough with a pencil or piece of tape so it's easy to tell when the dough has doubled. At this point, the dough is ready to be punched down and used in your recipe of choice.  Storing: The dough can be punched down and refrigerated overnight. Wrap in plastic, leaving a bit of wiggle room for when the dough continues to expand in the refrigerator, or place in a bowl large enough to allow it to expand; cover with plastic wrap. (If you don't leave room for expansion, the dough will burst through the plastic wrap.)

Grilled Peach and Watercress Salad with Prosciutto over Flat Bread Recipe | Sur La Table	Home /Recipes/Salads/Fruit & Vegetable/Grilled Peach and Watercress Salad with Prosciutto over Flat Bread	By Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes	Makes 4 servings	  Flatbread: Makes 1 pound; 2 (12-inch) or 4 (8-inch) pizzas ¼ cup (2 ounces) warm water (110°F to 115°F) 2¼ teaspoons Saf-Instant yeast 3¼ cups (16 1/4 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour or 00 “Italian style” flour 1½ teaspoons sea salt 1 cup (8 ounces) water 3 tablespoons (1½ ounces) extra virgin olive oil, plus 1 tablespoon for brushing  Grilled Peach Salad: Vegetable oil for brushing grill 2 ripe peaches, halved and pitted ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 4 cups watercress, washed and stemmed   Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 10 paper-thin slices of prosciutto, torn into 1-inch pieces 2 tablespoons aged balsamic vinegar  	The grill caramelizes the peaches and intensifies their sweet summer flavor. It&#8217;s a perfect match with peppery watercress and salty prosciutto.  To make the Flatbread Dough: Place the warm water in a small bowl and sprinkle with the yeast. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand for 5 minutes or until foamy. Stir to dissolve, if necessary.   In a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the flour and salt and mix briefly to combine. Turn the mixer on low speed, add the yeast mixture and mix to combine. Add the water and 3 tablespoons of olive oil and knead the dough until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Alternatively, you can knead the dough by hand on a floured surface for about 10 minutes.   Shape the dough into a smooth ball, place it on a floured surface and cover with an inverted bowl, plastic wrap or a damp cloth. Let rise at room temperature for about 1½ hours, or until doubled in bulk.   When the dough is ready, use a large knife or a bench scraper to divide it into 4 equal pieces. With lightly floured hands, press out any bubbles that might have formed in the dough and form each piece into a small smooth ball. Place about 4 inches apart on a lightly floured surface. Let rise for about 45 minutes. Once Risen, roll out each ball and brush olive oil on both sides.  To grill the Dough and Peaches: Preheat a grill or grill pan over medium-high heat.

Flaky Pie Dough Recipe | Sur La Table	Home /Recipes/Desserts/Pies, Pastries & Tarts/Flaky Pie Dough	By The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing, recipes by Cindy Mushet, photography by Maren Caruso	Makes 1 (9-inch) pie crust	  1¼ cups all-purpose flour ¼ teaspoon kosher salt 1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter, cold, cut into ½-inch cubes ¼ to &#8531; cup ice water  	 This recipe can be used to make both sweet and savory pies and tarts. You can make the dough ahead of time, wrap in plastic and refrigerate up to 2 days or freeze for 1 month. You can also save more time by making the dough in the food processor. Place the flour and cold butter in the processor bowl and pulse to cut the butter into the flour, then transfer to a large mixing bowl and proceed with the recipe. Make sure to weigh your ingredients for best results.  To make the dough, place the flour and salt in a large mixing bowl. Using a pastry blender, two knives or your fingers, cut or rub the butter into the flour mixture until the butter pieces are the size of peas. Sprinkle ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, over the flour mixture. Stir and fluff the flour mixture with a fork until shaggy clumps form. Pick up the large clumps and squeeze to test for moisture. If clumps hold together, transfer them to a work surface and continue adding tablespoons of ice water and stirring.  Gather the clumps of dough together on a work surface. If the butter feels soft, cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before proceeding. If the butter still feels cold, knead the dough gently 4 or 5 times. If dough falls apart, return it to the mixing bowl and sprinkle teaspoons of ice water and mix with a fork until dough holds together when squeezed.   Flatten the dough into a disk about 6 inches wide, cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes before rolling.  	
Nectarine and Raspberry Galette Recipe | Sur La Table	Home /Recipes/Desserts/Pies, Pastries & Tarts/Nectarine and Raspberry Galette	By Eating Local: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing, recipes by Janet Fletcher, photography by Sara Remington	Makes 8 servings	  Galette Dough: 2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour &#190; teaspoon kosher or sea salt ½ cup plus 7 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled, cut into small pieces About ¼ cup ice water  Filling: 1½ pounds nectarines, halved, pitted, and sliced lengthwise ½ pint raspberries 3 tablespoons granulated sugar 1 large egg yolk whisked with 1 teaspoon water, for egg wash About 1 tablespoon sparkling sugar (coarse decorating sugar)  	You can adapt this galette to other summer fruits, such as apricots, plums or berries. In the fall, fill it with apples or pears. The beauty of a galette&#8212;a tart with a wide rim of dough folded over the fruit&#8212;is its rusticity. It should look like a grandmother, not a pastry chef, made it.  To make the dough: Put the flour and salt in a food processor and pulse a few times to blend. Add half the butter and pulse just until the fat is evenly distributed and coated with flour. Add the remaining butter and pulse a few times, just until it is coated with flour. There should still be pieces of flour-coated butter about the size of large peas. Transfer the mixture to a bowl.   Drizzle in the ice water while tossing with a fork, adding water just until the mixture begins to come together. Gather the dough with your hands and knead gently if necessary to get it to hold together. Resist the temptation to add more water. Handling the dough as little as possible, shape it into a thick disk like a hamburger patty, then wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, at least 2 hours or up to 1 day.  Preheat the oven to 425&deg;F. If you have a baking stone, put it in the oven on the middle rack to preheat for at least 45 minutes.  Remove the dough from the refrigerator about 10 minutes before you are ready to roll it to allow it to soften slightly. If it is too cold, it will be brittle and difficult to roll. Unwrap the dough and place it between 2 sheets of parchment paper at least 16 inches square. With a rolling pin, flatten the dough into a 15-inch circle.   To prevent sticking, occasionally lift the top sheet of parchment and lightly flour the dough, then replace the parchment and invert the dough so the bottom sheet is on top. Peel back that sheet of parchment and lightly flour the dough, then replace the parchment and continue rolling.  When the circle is large enough, remove the top sheet of parchment and transfer the dough, still on the bottom sheet of parchment, to a rimless baking sheet.   To assemble the galette: Working 2 inches from the edge of the dough, place the nectarine slices in concentric rings. Scatter the raspberries evenly over the nectarines. Sprinkle the fruit with the granulated sugar.  Using a palette knife or other broad knife to help you lift the dough off the parchment, gently fold the uncovered edge of the dough over the fruit to make a wide, rough-edged rim. Make sure there are no cracks in the dough for juices to seep through. Brush the rim with the egg wash, then sprinkle the rim with the sparkling sugar. With scissors, cut off the exposed parchment paper. (It&#8217;s okay if a little paper is exposed.)  Baking and serving: If you have a baking stone in the oven, slide the galette, still on the bottom sheet of parchment, directly onto the stone. If you do not have a baking stone, bake the galette on the rimless baking sheet. Bake until the crust is golden and the nectarines are juicy, about 50 minutes. Slide the galette onto a rack to cool slightly. To serve, slide it from the rack onto a cutting board and cut into wedges. Serve warm.

Cedar-Plank Honey-Bourbon Nectarines Recipe | Sur La Table	Home /Recipes/Desserts/Dessert Sauces/Cedar-Plank Honey-Bourbon Nectarines	By Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen	Makes 4 servings	  2 cedar planks  &#8532; cup bourbon ¼ cup honey ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 4 ripe but firm nectarines, pitted and quartered ½ tablespoon lemon juice  	Cedar wood imparts a lush, smoky aroma and flavor.  When cooking with planks, they need to be immersed in water at least an hour prior to grilling. A water-soaked plank produces a maximum smoke flavor and is more resistant to charring on the grill.  Fully emerge cedar planks in cold water, at least an hour prior to cooking  In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the bourbon, honey and pepper. Bring to the boil and then reduce the heat to a simmer until the liquid has reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let cool.   Arrange the nectarines, flesh side up, in a dish just enough to hold them in one layer and brush with lemon juice.  Use a silicone brush to lightly coat the nectarines with half of the honey-bourbon mixture and allow to marinate for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour.   Prepare a moderate charcoal fire or preheat a gas grill to medium. Close grill lid and preheat to around 375°F. Alternatively, preheat an oven to 375°F and place a rack in the center.  Remove the soaked cedar plank from the water and place on a grill rack. Close the grill and allow the board to heat for a few minutes until it begins to smoke or crackle. If using a plank for the first time, season the plank by placing it on a preheated grill for 2 minutes, turning once. Lightly toasting the plank on both sides will intensify its smoky flavor and prevent warping. When the plank starts crackling, it&#8217;s ready for cooking.  Using tongs, arrange the nectarines, cut side up, on the cedar plank. Cover the grill, or close the oven, and cook until nectarines are hot and tender, about 5 minutes.   To serve: Remove the plank from the grill or oven and transfer to a dessert plate. Drizzle with remaining honey-bourbon mixture and garnish with a dollop of freshly whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.  	
Beet and Goat Cheese Ravioli with Arugula Pesto Recipe | Sur La Table	Home /Recipes/Main Courses/Grains, Legumes & Pasta/Beet and Goat Cheese Ravioli with Arugula Pesto	By Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen	Makes 4 servings	  1 (6 to 8 ounce) red beet, cleaned ¼ cup fresh goat cheese 1 egg, beaten 2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 recipe fresh pasta dough (ingredients below)  2 cloves garlic, peeled &#190; cup almonds, toasted and chopped  4 cups packed arugula, wash and dried, stems removed 3 cups packed Italian flat-leaf parsley, washed and dried, stems removed 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/3 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese ¼ cup sherry vinegar Juice of one lemon Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper  Basic Pasta Dough: Serves 2 as a main course and 4 as an appetizer.    1 cup all purpose flour 1 egg 1 tablespoon olive oil Salt  	This perfectly balanced dish combines earthy beets with a mild, creamy goat cheese. The nutty, yet slightly spicy, pesto offers depth of flavor and a wonderful, bright green color burst.   To prepare the ravioli filling: Preheat an oven to 425 degrees and position a rack in the middle. Wrap the beet in aluminum foil and place in a roasting pan and roast until tender, about 40 minutes. Transfer from the oven and let cool. Clean the beet and cut into quarters. In a food processor, fitted with a metal blade, add the beets and process until smooth. Add the goat cheese, egg and Parmesan. Season with salt and pepper and set aside.   To prepare arugula pesto: In the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade, add garlic, almonds, arugula and parsley. Pulse to roughly chop. Add olive oil in a steady stream and process to a smooth paste. Stop motor and add cheese, vinegar and lemon juice, stirring by hand to combine. Taste and season with salt, pepper and more vinegar as needed.  To prepare the pasta dough: Mound the flour on a work surface. Make a well in the center of the flour and add the egg, olive oil and salt.  Mix the egg and oil together with a fork and gradually incorporate some of the flour to make a smooth dough.  When the dough has formed enough that you can handle it, continue to work in the flour by hand (without the fork). When the dough is no longer sticky, roll it with the pasta machine (continue to add flour) and cut the ribbons into 3-inch squares.   To prepare ravioli: Place 2 teaspoons of the filling in the center of each pasta square. Bring 1 corner of the square to the other, forming a triangle and seal the pasta completely. Add the pasta to a pot of boiling salted water. Reserve ¼cup of the pasta cooking water. Cook until al dente, about 2 to 3 minutes or until the pasta floats and is pale in color.   Remove the pasta from the water and drain well. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer the pasta to a medium bowl. Add one tablespoon of pesto at a time, tossing with each new addition until the pasta is well coated, adding pasta water and seasoning if necessary.                                              To serve: Divide the ravioli between 4 warmed serving plates and serve immediately.

(approximately 15 minutes)  Remove the pan from the heat and add the fresh basil, stir to combine. Add the arugula and toss.  Serve the pasta with grated fresh Parmesan cheese.  	
Wild Mushroom Risotto with Truffle Oil Recipe | Sur La Table	Home /Recipes/Main Courses/Grains, Legumes & Pasta/Wild Mushroom Risotto with Truffle Oil		Makes 4 servings	  6 to 8 cups chicken stock Boiling water, as needed 1 tablespoon olive oil ½ stick (¼ cup) unsalted butter, divided ¼ pound fresh wild mushrooms (porcini, chanterelles or hedgehogs) trimmed and chopped into ½-inch pieces &#8531; cup (about 2 medium) finely chopped shallots 2 cups (about 14 ounces) Arborio or Carnaroli rice ¼ to ½ teaspoon white truffle oil, or to taste &#190; cup (1½ ounces) grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese 1 teaspoon chopped fresh chives  	Pour the chicken stock into a large saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Decrease the heat to the lowest setting, cover and keep hot.  Fill a small saucepan with water and heat over high heat until boiling. Lower heat, cover and keep hot.   In another large saucepan, heat olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter over medium-high heat until butter foams. When foaming subsides, add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and any liquid they release is evaporated, about 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to a bowl using a slotted spoon. Set aside.   Return the saucepan to medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons butter and heat until butter foams. When foaming subsides, cook shallots until softened, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add rice and cook, stirring constantly until evenly coated with butter and heated through, about 3 minutes. Increase heat to medium and, using a ladle, add about 1 cup of hot stock to the rice. Cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, over medium heat until stock is almost fully absorbed. Add the remaining stock ½-cup at a time, stirring constantly and adding more broth only after the previous addition has been absorbed, until the rice begins to pull away from the sides of the pan, about 16 to 20 minutes. Adjust the heat so the rice simmers rapidly throughout the cooking. Use boiling water if stock has been used and rice requires more cooking time.  The risotto is done when it is creamy and the grains are plump and tender with a slight resistance to the bite. Season to taste with salt and white pepper. Remove from heat and stir in the remaining 1 tablespoon butter, saut&#233;ed mushrooms, truffle oil to taste, and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. If risotto is thick, use any leftover stock to thin as needed. To serve, ladle risotto into 4 warmed shallow serving bowls. Sprinkle with chives and serve immediately.

Liberally season both sides of your flank steak with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. You are welcome to use more or less of any of these ingredients to your taste.  Use the immersion method to release as much air as possible from the bag and seal.  Place into the heated bath and set the timer for 90 minutes.  Remove from the bath and pat dry with paper towel or kitchen cloth.  Sear as desired. We used a cast iron pan brushed with 1 Tablespoon avocado oil.  Slice 1/4 - 1/2"/6 - 12mm thick against the grain to optimize tenderness and set aside.  While the steak is in the bath, preheat oven to 400ºF/205ºC.  Peel and cut potato into thin batonnets, about 1/4" x 1/4" x 2-3" dimensions. (6mm x 6mm x 5-6cm)  In a small bowl, toss the potato sticks with 2 Tablespoons olive oil, 2 Tablespoons parmesan, 1 Tablespoon parsley, 1/2 teaspoons of salt & pepper.  Transfer to a baking tray lined with parchment and place in a single layer.  Pop in the warmed oven for 30 minutes, flipping at the 15 minute mark.  Red Wine Shallot Sauce:  Once potatoes are in the oven, add 2 Tablespoons olive oil and 1 Tablespoon butter to a saute pan over medium high heat. Once melted, add the minced shallot and a pinch of salt. Stir to coat shallot with melted butter/olive oil combination, and sweat for 3 minutes while it starts to become translucent.  Add the sugar or substitute, crushed garlic clove, wine, and chicken stock and reduce the mixture by 2/3, which will take about 15 minutes. Once the reduction is complete, remove the pan from heat.  Divide sliced steak between two plates and drizzle with red wine sauce. Top with frites, garnish with 1 Tablespoon per plate of chopped parsley, and enjoy! We added a little bowl of Cheater's Aioli for dipping, too.

Drizzle pesto over burger, and top with crumbled feta cheese. Serve immediately.  	
Spent Coffee Short Rib Chili Recipe | Sur La Table	Home /Recipes/Main Courses/Meat/Spent Coffee Short Rib Chili	By Recipe courtesy of Scraps	Makes 6 servings	  1 tablespoon grapeseed oil 2 ½ pounds boneless beef short ribs Coarse sea salt 3 medium yellow onions, peeled and chopped 2 tablespoons chili powder 2 tablespoons ground cumin 1 tablespoon smoked paprika 2 tablespoons dark brown sugar 1 star anise ½ cup brandy 1 (28-ounce) can diced tomatoes 2 tablespoons spent coffee grounds 1 quart chicken stock, homemade or bought 1 ½ cups French brown lentils 1 cup packaged fried shallots (get them at any Asian grocery or online)  2 cups shredded sharp white cheddar cheese  	Imagine how many cups of coffee are brewed every single morning, and every one of those cups results in a couple of tablespoons of used coffee grounds. The aroma of coffee is intoxicating, and it’s still there even after the beans are spent. I love their roasted chocolate notes with assertive red meats, like the short ribs in this chili.   Get the oil hot in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Season the short ribs with a good amount of salt. Brown the meat on all sides for about 3 minutes per side. Don’t crowd the pot. If the pieces of meat touch, they will steam and not brown. Remove them and continue browning the rest of the short ribs. Remove onto the pot lid, turned upside down to catch the juices.  Add the onions to the Dutch oven and cook until they start to brown, about 5 minutes. Stir when it looks like they could use stirring.  Stir in the ground spices, brown sugar, and star anise and cook until the smell of the spices is strong, a minute or so.  Add the brandy. Stand back, as the brandy could flame. If it does, cover with a lid to douse the flames. Another lid, not the one holding the short ribs. Cook until the pot is almost dry. Add the tomatoes with their juices. Add the spent coffee grounds, stock, short ribs, and any accumulated juices. Cover and simmer over low heat until the meat is fork-tender, about 2½ hours.  Stir in the lentils and continue to simmer, covered, until the lentils are tender, about 30 minutes.  Remove the short ribs from the chili. Using two forks, shred the meat into bite-size pieces. Stir back into the chili. Serve garnished with the fried shallots and cheese. 	
Oaxacan-Style Roasted Pork Tenderloin with Mole Verde Recipe | Sur La Table	Home /Recipes/Main Courses/Meat/Oaxacan-Style Roasted Pork Tenderloin with Mole Verde	By Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes	Makes 4 servings	  Pork marinade: 3 whole guajillo or pasilla chiles  ¼ cup water  ¼ cup apple cider vinegar           3 medium garlic cloves   1½ teaspoons sea salt  1 teaspoon black pepper, freshly ground               2 teaspoons Mexican oregano  1 teaspoon ground cinnamon      ¼ teaspoon ground cloves 2 tablespoons vegetable oil  1½ pounds pork tenderloin, trimmed as needed    Green mole: ½ pound tomatillos, husked, rinsed and halved ½ large white onion, roughly chopped 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided  Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper &#8531; cup raw green pumpkin seeds (pepitas)  1 large garlic clove, chopped 1 medium jalapeno, seeded and chopped 1 teaspoon toasted and freshly ground cumin  1 teaspoon Mexican oregano 1 teaspoon sugar (optional)  2 cups low-sodium chicken broth, plus more as needed   1 cup loosely packed fresh cilantro leaves, plus more for garnish  ¼ cup loosely packed flat-leaf parsley ½ cup fresh epazote (optional)  1 to 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice  Warm tortillas, for serving   	Tomatillos are a staple in Mexican cuisine, often used in green salsas and sauces like mole. The tomatillo fruit is surrounded by an inedible, paper-like husk that must be removed. The fruit is often slightly sticky and should be rinsed to remove any dirt or particles before using.  To prepare the marinade: In a heavy skillet over medium heat, toast chiles, turning frequently, until darkened and soft, about 30 seconds. Transfer to a cutting board, remove stems and seeds.  Place chiles in a small saucepan with water and vinegar and place over medium heat to hydrate for 10 minutes. Transfer softened chiles and liquid to a blender. Add remaining marinade ingredients, except pork, and blend smooth. Once cooled, place the pork in a dish and pour marinade over, refrigerate for 2 to 4 hours, turning a couple of times throughout. Let tenderloin sit out at room temperature for 30 minutes before roasting.     Preheat oven to 425°F, with racks placed in the center and upper portion of the oven.    To prepare the mole: In a medium bowl, combine tomatillos, onion and one tablespoon oil; toss to coat. Transfer to a baking sheet and lightly season with salt and pepper. Roast in the oven for 15 minutes or until tomatillos and onions are browned and crispy on the edges.   In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, add remaining tablespoon of oil. Toast pumpkin seeds in the hot oil, stirring constantly, until they have expanded and begin to pop, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and jalapeno to the pan and saut&#233; until aromatic, about 1 minute.  Add cumin and oregano, roasted tomatillos and onion, sugar, ½ teaspoon of salt, chicken broth and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally for 10 minutes.   Remove saucepan from heat, add cilantro, parsley and epazote if using, and puree with an immersion blender, or transfer to a blender. (If using a blender, start on the lowest setting and remember to vent the lid to release the steam.) Once pureed smooth, reheat sauce over medium-low heat. Adjust consistency with additional broth as needed. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt, pepper and lime juice.  To roast tenderloin: Line a roasting pan or rimmed baking sheet with foil and place a wire rack over. Drizzle oil over the meat and spoon marinade over to evenly coat. Set tenderloin on the prepared roasting rack and transfer to the oven and roast for 25 to 30 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer placed in the thickest part of the meat registers 145°F. Transfer to a cutting board and rest for 10 minutes, tented loosely with foil.   To serve: Slice tenderloin at an angle into thin pieces. Spoon mole into the center of a large serving platter and arrange tenderloin over the top, garnish with cilantro and serve with warm tortillas. Note: pork pictured with grilled zucchini.

Walnut Pesto Stuffed Pork Roast Recipe | Sur La Table	Home /Recipes/Main Courses/Meat/Walnut Pesto Stuffed Pork Roast	By Sur La Table & Andrews McMeel Publishing	Makes 8 servings	  Brine: ½ cup coarse salt 1 cup hot water 2 quarts very cold water 1 cup ice cubes 1 (3½- to 4-pound) boneless pork loin, untied   Walnut Pesto: 3 cups packed fresh basil leaves 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil ½ cup chopped walnuts 2 cloves garlic, chopped 1 teaspoon coarse salt ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper &#178;&#8260;3 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese  	 Brining time: 12 to 24 hours Prep time: 15 minutes Cook time: 1¼ hours   In summer, when big bunches of fresh basil are sold everywhere, take advantage of the bounty and make batches of pesto. Classic pesto is typically made with basil, pine nuts, and pecorino romano cheese, but this adaptation is made with walnuts and Parmesan cheese and is slathered in the center and on top of the pork roast. Because the loin is lean, brining is recommended for 12 to 24 hours before roasting.   Walnut Pesto: One day before roasting the pork, make the brine: In a large bowl, dissolve the salt in the hot water. Add the cold water and the ice cubes. Place the pork in a large, heavy-duty resealable plastic bag. Add the brine and seal the bag closed. Seal it in a second plastic bag for reinforcement. (Or, use any large container and cover it tightly.) Place on a rimmed sheet pan and refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours. When ready to cook, drain the brining liquid and discard, and then wipe the roast dry with paper towels. Let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes before roasting.  Meanwhile, make the pesto: In blender or food processor, combine the basil, ½ cup of the oil, and the walnuts, garlic, salt, and pepper, and process until finely chopped. With the motor running, slowly add the remaining ½ cup of olive oil and process until the mixture is well blended. Be careful not to overprocess the pesto. You should be able to see small pieces of basil throughout. Transfer the pesto to a small bowl and stir in the cheese.  Preheat the oven to 400°F. Have ready a large roasting pan with a rack. Cut 8 pieces of cooking string each about 18 inches long, or have ready silicone ties. Place the pork loin on a cutting board and butterfly it by making a slit along the side from the top to the bottom, cutting just deep enough so that the loin opens up and lies flat like a book. Using a thin, flat metal spatula or a narrow rubber spatula, slather the cut surface with about ½ cup of the pesto. Fold it over and tie firmly, but not too tightly, at 1- inch intervals with the lengths of string or the ties.  Place the tied loin on the rack in the roasting pan. Roast for 45 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and slather about ¼ cup of the remaining pesto on top of the roast. Continue roasting for 30 minutes longer, or until an instant-read thermometer registers 135°F. Remove from the oven and let rest for 10 minutes. As the pork rests, the internal temperature will rise to 145°F, or medium-rare.  Using 2 broad spatulas, lift the roast from the rack to a cutting board. Snip off the strings, or remove the silicone ties. Cut the pork into ½-inch-thick slices. Arrange the slices, overlapping them, on a large platter. Drizzle any juices from the cutting board over the meat. Serve warm or at room temperature. Pass the remaining pesto at the table.  	
Arroz con Pollo with Chorizo and Capers Recipe | Sur La Table		By Knives Cooks Love:&nbsp;Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing, recipes by Sarah Jay, photography by Ben Fink	Makes 6 servings	  8 ounces Mexican chorizo or sweet Italian sausage 1 (3- to 3½-pound) chicken, cut into 8 serving pieces (see page 154), wings and back reserved for stock 2½ teaspoons kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1½ teaspoons ground cumin &#190; teaspoon paprika ¼ teaspoon ground turmeric &#185;&#8260;8 teaspoon chili powder 1 onion, cut into ¼-inch dice (see page 96) 1 red bell pepper, cut into ½- inch dice (see page 116) 5 large cloves garlic, chopped coarsely (see page 100) &#190; cup dry white wine &#190; cup crushed canned tomatoes 1 bay leaf 2¼ cups medium-grain rice 2½ cups chicken broth 3 tablespoons capers in brine, drained but not rinsed Lemon wedges and hot sauce, for serving (optional)  	When using a cut-up whole chicken (rather than only legs and thighs) for this dish, you need to take precautions to keep the breast meat from drying out. The trick is to sear the breast pieces briefly and then add them to the rice halfway through cooking. Mexican chorizo, a fresh sausage seasoned with garlic and paprika, delivers more authentic flavor. Look for it in Hispanic groceries.  Cut the chorizo in half lengthwise, then crosswise into 1-inch chunks (it&#8217;s easier if the casing side is up; the casing shouldn&#8217;t come off, but if it does, just discard it). Set aside.  Pat the chicken pieces dry with paper towels. Season with 2 teaspoons of the kosher salt and a few grinds of pepper. Heat the oil in a medium (5-quart) Dutch oven or heavy casserole over medium-high heat. Sear the drumsticks and thighs until deeply golden on all sides, 7 to 10 minutes (use a splatter screen if you have one). Transfer the pieces to a large bowl. Sear the breast pieces on the skin side only until golden, about 3 minutes. Transfer them to the bowl. Lower the heat to medium and sear the chorizo, stirring frequently, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the chorizo to the bowl.  Pour off and discard all but 1 tablespoon of oil. Spoon out any burnt bits. Combine the cumin, paprika, turmeric, and chili powder in a small dish. Set the pot over medium heat and add the onion and bell pepper. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring often; the moisture in the vegetables will deglaze the browned drippings in the pan. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until the vegetables are softened, about 3 minutes. Add the measured spices and cook, stirring, for 1 minute to let the flavors bloom.  Add the wine, tomatoes, the remaining ½ teaspoon salt, and the bay leaf. Increase the heat to medium-high and simmer for 2 minutes. Add the drumsticks, thighs, and chorizo to the pot. Add the rice and broth. Bring to a boil, cover, lower the heat to medium-low, and simmer for 9 minutes.  Add the breast pieces to the pot, nestling them into the rice, and continue simmering until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed, about 9 minutes more.  Remove the pan from the heat and let rest, covered, for 5 minutes. Sprinkle the capers on top of the rice. When spooning out portions, look for the bay leaf and discard it. Serve with the lemon wedges and hot sauce.  	
Beer Braised Short Ribs Recipe | Sur La Table	Home /Recipes/Main Courses/Meat/Beer Braised Short Ribs	By Rebecca White, A Pleasant Little Kitchen	Makes 6 to 8 servings	  4½ pounds bone-in short ribs 3 tsp kosher salt 2 tbsp canola oil ½ cup shallots, chopped ¼ cup carrots, chopped 2 garlic cloves, crushed 2 tbsp tomato paste 2 (12-ounce) bottles of light amber beer ½ tsp worcestershire sauce 1 tbsp Dijon mustard ¼ cup brown sugar 2 bay leaves  	 Short ribs are browned and then braised in a liquid full of flavor: browned tomato paste, aromatic vegetables, dijon mustard, brown sugar and amber beer. After 2½ hours in the oven, the result is tender savory short ribs, which are perfect for any dining occasion.  One hour before cooking, remove the meat from the fridge.  Heat the oven to 350°F.  With 2½ teaspoons of salt, evenly season the short ribs on all sides.  In a large Dutch oven, heat the oil over high on the stove top. Once hot add the short ribs and brown 3 minutes per side, for a total of 6 minutes, and set aside. This should be done in 2 batches.  Lower the heat to medium low and remove the Dutch oven from the heat. Add the shallots, carrots and garlic, and continue to cook off the heat for 2 minutes.  Add the Dutch oven back to the stove top, and then add the tomato paste, cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently.   Add ½ cup of the beer to the paste and deglaze the pan. Once the brown bits are scraped from the pan, add the sugar, Dijon, worcestershire, bay leaves and the remaining ½ teaspoon of salt. Mix well.  Place the short ribs back into the Dutch oven. Pour the remaining contents of the 12-ounce beer plus the second bottle of beer to submerge the short ribs just over halfway.   Bring the beer mixture to a boil, cover the Dutch oven, and place it in the oven.  Cook for 2½ to 3 hours. Serve warm.

Roast Chicken with Bread and Arugula Salad by Ina Garten Recipe | Sur La Table	Home /Recipes/Main Courses/Poultry/Roast Chicken with Bread and Arugula Salad by Ina Garten	By Ina Garten, Make it Ahead	Makes 4 servings	 Roast Chicken   1 (4- to 4½-pound) whole chicken, preferably Bell & Evans 4 sprigs fresh thyme 2 large garlic cloves, smashed flat 1 lemon, quartered 2 teaspoons fine sea salt, plus extra for serving ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 3 to 4 (&#190;-inch-thick) slices country bread Good olive oil    Arugula Salad    ¼ cup Champagne vinegar 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 1 teaspoon minced garlic Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper ½ cup good olive oil ½ cup thinly sliced scallions, white and green parts (3 scallions)  2 tablespoons dried currants 6 cups baby arugula, lightly packed (6 to 8 ounces)    Note: Baby arugula holds up better than traditional arugula under the warm chicken. 	This incredibly delicious roast chicken is inspired by Zuni Cafe in San Francisco. It&#8217;s Ina&#8217;s homage to the late Judy Rodgers&#8217; passion for rustic country food.  MAKE IT AHEAD:   Up to a day ahead, season the chicken and clean the arugula.  Prepare the vinaigrette and refrigerate separately. Roast the chicken and assemble the salad before serving.  PREP AND BAKE THE CHICKEN:   Place the chicken in a baking dish. Using your fingers, gently loosen the skin from the breasts and thighs without breaking the skin. Carefully slide the sprigs of thyme and the garlic under the skin. Put the lemon in the cavity. Tie the legs together and tuck the wings under the body. Sprinkle with 2 teaspoons of sea salt and the pepper, cover the dish tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 24 to 48 hours.  Preheat the oven to 500°F. (Be sure your oven is very clean!) Place the bread in a medium (10-inch) cast-iron skillet in a single layer. Brush the chicken with olive oil and place it, breast side up, on top of the bread. Roast for 30 minutes, turn it over and roast for 15 minutes, until the juices run clear when you cut between the leg and the thigh. Wrap the skillet tightly with aluminum foil and allow the chicken to rest at room temperature for a full 30 minutes. (Don&#8217;t worry; it will stay hot.) The bread will be almost burnt on the bottom and soft with the pan drippings on top.  MAKE THE VINAIGRETTE:   Whisk the vinegar, mustard, garlic, 1 teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper together in a small bowl or glass measuring cup. Whisk in the olive oil, stir in the scallions and currants and set aside. Place the arugula in a large bowl, add the vinaigrette and toss well.  TO SERVE:   Place the Arugula Salad in a very large, shallow serving platter. Put the chicken and the bread on a cutting board. Cut the bread into 1-inch squares and sprinkle them on the salad.  Carve the chicken thickly and place it on top of the salad. To carve, cut off the legs and cut between the thigh and the leg. For the breasts, cut the wings off, remove each breast in one large piece, and make thick slices crosswise. Spoon the pan juices over the chicken, sprinkle it with sea salt and serve warm over the salad. 	
Grilled Eggplant Cannelloni with Ricotta and Prosciutto Recipe | Sur La Table	Home /Recipes/Main Courses/Vegetarian/Grilled Eggplant Cannelloni with Ricotta and Prosciutto	By Eating Local: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing, recipes by Janet Fletcher, photography by Sara Remington	Makes 4 servings	  2 large globe eggplants, 1¼ to 1½ pounds each Kosher or sea salt 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil  Tomato Sauce: ¼ cup extra virgin olive oil ½ yellow onion, minced 2 large cloves garlic, minced 1½ pounds plum (Roma type) tomatoes, chopped (no need to peel) 8 to 12 fresh basil leaves 1 teaspoon dried oregano Pinch of hot red pepper flakes Kosher or sea salt  Ricotta Filling: 2 cups whole-milk ricotta cheese (or one 15-oz. container) ½ cup freshly grated pecorino or Parmigiano Reggiano cheese 1/3 cup minced prosciutto 2 tablespoons minced fresh Italian parsley 1 large clove garlic, minced Freshly ground black pepper 1 large egg, lightly beaten  ½ cup freshly grated pecorino or Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, for topping  	Lengthwise slices from a large eggplant become supple when grilled, so you can roll them around a ricotta filling as if you were making cannelloni from pasta squares. Blanketed with a homemade fresh-tomato sauce and baked until bubbly and a little crusty around the edges, the fork-tender bundles of stuffed eggplant are the ultimate Italian comfort food.  Slice off the eggplants' green cap, then cut each eggplant lengthwise into slices about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> inch thick. Discard the first and last slices, which are mostly skin. You should get at least 6 large slices from each eggplant. Sprinkle them generously on both sides with salt, then set the slices on a rack and let stand for 30 minutes. Moisture will bead on the surface.  Prepare a moderate charcoal fire or preheat a gas grill to medium (375&deg;F). Pat the eggplant slices dry with paper towels, then brush on both sides with the olive oil. Place the slices directly over the coals or gas flame and cook, turning once, until they are nicely marked by the grill and pliable, about 3 minutes per side. They do not need to be fully cooked as they will cook further in the oven. Set the slices aside on a tray to cool.  To make the tomato sauce, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over moderate heat. Add the onion and garlic and saut&#233; until the onion is soft and beginning to color, 5 to 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring often, until they soften and collapse into a sauce, about 10 minutes, depending on ripeness.  Remove from the heat, and pass the mixture through a food mill fitted with the fine disk. Return the puree to the skillet over moderate heat. Tear the basil leaves in half and add to the skillet along with the oregano (rubbing it between your fingers as you do), the hot pepper flakes, and salt to taste. Simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thick and tasty. Set aside.  To make the ricotta filling, put the ricotta, pecorino, prosciutto, parsley, and garlic in a medium bowl. Stir until blended, then season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir in the egg.  Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F. Choose a shallow baking dish large enough to hold all the eggplant rolls snugly in one layer. Spread <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> cup of the tomato sauce on the bottom of the dish.  Put a generous 2 tablespoons filling on each eggplant slice and spread it evenly. Carefully roll each slice like a jelly roll, and place the rolls, seam side down, in the baking dish. Top with the remaining tomato sauce, spreading it evenly. Sprinkle the pecorino evenly over the top. Bake until lightly browned and bubbling, about 45 minutes. Cool for 20 minutes before serving.  	
Basil Ricotta Ravioli with a Roasted Tomato Sauce Recipe | Sur La Table	Home /Recipes/Main Courses/Grains, Legumes & Pasta/Basil Ricotta Ravioli with a Roasted Tomato Sauce	By Kristan Raines, The Broken Bread		 Pasta Dough   1 ½ cups + 2 tbs /188g 00 flour, plus extra for dusting ½ tsp fine sea salt 2 large eggs Semolina, optional, for dusting    Ricotta Filling  6 oz well-drained ricotta cheese &#8531; cup grated parmesan reggiano 1 ½ tbs freshly chopped basil ¼ tsp kosher salt Few cracks of fresh black pepper 1 large egg    Roasted Tomato Sauce  1 ½ lb cherry tomatoes 1 small onion, cut into 1/4-inch wedges  3 cloves garlic 2 tbs olive oil 1 tbs fresh oregano leaves ½ tsp kosher salt Few cracks of fresh black pepper  	Begin by making the pasta. Place a mound of flour on a clean work surface and form a well in the middle. Sprinkle the salt over the top of the mound, then carefully crack each egg into the center of the well.  Using a fork, begin whisking the eggs together while slowly incorporating the flour from the mound. Continue this process until a shaggy dough forms.  Knead the dough for 8-10 minutes, or until the dough becomes elastic and smooth. If the dough seems too sticky, add a little extra flour as needed. Shape the dough into a ball, flatten into a disc, and cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough rest at room temperature for a minimum of 30 minutes and up to 1 hour.  While the pasta is resting, prepare the tomato sauce and ricotta filling.  For the sauce, place the tomatoes, onion, and garlic into a medium baking pan with 2-inch tall sides. Drizzle with olive oil and then add oregano, salt, and pepper. Toss everything a few times to combine and place in the oven at 400°F for 35-45 minutes, or until the tomatoes have wilted and appear slightly charred.   Once the tomatoes are ready, remove from the oven and let cool slightly. Add everything to a blender and blend until smooth. Taste and add additional salt and pepper as needed. Pour sauce into a saucepan and set aside.  For the filling, simply mix the ricotta, parmigiano reggiano, basil, salt, and pepper together. Taste and add additional salt as needed, then mix in the egg until well combined. Cover and store in the fridge.  Begin making the ravioli. Quarter the pasta dough. Working with one piece at a time (leaving the other pieces wrapped), lightly dust the quarter with flour and flatten it with a rolling pin until it&#8217;s about as wide as the pasta roller and about ½-inch thick.   Feed the dough through the machine at its widest setting. Fold the long ends of the dough into the center, flatten it, and feed it through the machine again at its widest setting. Repeat this exact process two more times.  Feed the sheet through the machine at a width two settings narrower than the widest, making sure to flour after it has rolled through. Repeat this at the setting two more steps narrower than the last, flouring again. Repeat one last time at either the narrowest setting available or at the machine&#8217;s suggested width for ravioli.  At this point the sheet will be really long, so cut it in half and transfer to a large baking pan sprinkled with semolina flour. Repeat this process for the remaining pieces of dough, making sure to sprinkle a bit of semolina between the sheets so they don&#8217;t stick.    Dollop the ricotta filling, 1 tsp at a time, onto a half sheet of pasta. Place the dollops 1 inch from one another, and fit as many as you can on each sheet.   Using a wet finger, or a pastry brush dipped in water, moisten the dough around each dollop of filling. Now place a second sheet of dough onto the half with dollops of fillings, pressing around the filling to secure a proper seal between the two pieces of dough.  Use a small, square ravioli stamp to cut out the pieces of pasta. Set these aside onto a sheet dusted with semolina flour. You should end up with 25-30 ravioli.  Once this is complete, bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. Meanwhile, set the saucepan containing the tomato sauce to medium-low heat. Boil the ravioli for 3-4 minutes, strain, and add to the pot with the tomato sauce, gently tossing to coat. Divide between 2 bowls, top with freshly-grated parmesan reggiano, sliced basil leaves, and enjoy immediately.	
Beef, Barley and Vegetable Soup Recipe | Sur La Table	Home /Recipes/Main Courses/Meat/Beef, Barley and Vegetable Soup	By Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen	Makes 6 servings	  2 tablespoons olive oil, divided 8 ounces London broil, cut into 3/4-inch cubes Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 yellow onion, cut into 1/2-inch dice 2 medium carrots, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice 1 celery ribs, cut into 1/2-inch dice 4 ounces cremini mushrooms, thinly sliced 1 garlic clove, minced 1 tablespoon tomato paste 1/2 cup dry red wine 6 to 8 cups low-sodium beef broth 1 bay leaf 1/2 cup pearled barley 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar (optional)   	To a large saucepan or Dutch oven set over medium-high heat, add 1 tablespoon oil; season beef with salt and pepper. When oil is shimmering, add beef to the pan, in batches, and cook until browned on all sides, about 8 minutes. Use a slotted spoon or spider to transfer the beef to a plate. To the same pan, add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil. When oil is shimmering, add onion, carrot, and celery and cook until vegetables are browned and tender, about 8 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook until tender, about 5 minutes more. Stir in the garlic and tomato paste and cook until fragrant and caramelized, about 2 minutes.

Tagliatelle Carbonara with Crispy Mushrooms Recipe Recipe | Sur La Table	Home /Recipes/Main Courses/Grains, Legumes & Pasta/Tagliatelle Carbonara with Crispy Mushrooms Recipe	By Molly Krebs	Makes 4 servings	  2 large eggs 2 large egg yolks 1½ cups finely grated parmesan cheese, divided, plus extra for serving ¼ teaspoon salt ¼ teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper 8 slices thick-cut bacon, chopped ¼ cup extra virgin olive oil 1 pound wild mushrooms, sliced 1 pound tagliatelle pasta ½ cup reserved pasta water 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh rosemary 1-2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley	 Fresh basil leaves, for serving  	In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, egg yolks, 1 cup of the parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper, until smooth. Set aside while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.  Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add the chopped bacon. Cook for 8 minutes, or until bacon is golden brown and crispy. Remove bacon from pan and add to a paper towel lined plate. Pour bacon fat into a small bowl, leaving 1-2 tablespoons in the pan for the mushrooms. Save the reserved bacon fat for the sauce later. Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to a boil for the pasta.  Add ¼ cup olive oil to the skillet with the 1-2 tablespoons of bacon fat. Heat over medium-high heat, and once hot, add the mushrooms and a few cracks of freshly ground black pepper. Cook for 12-15 minutes, tossing the mushrooms only a few times, so that they get deeply golden and crispy. Once they're finished, season with salt and stir in the chopped rosemary. Remove mushrooms from pan and set aside. Add the reserved bacon fat to the skillet so that it's ready for the pasta!  At this point, your pasta water should be boiling. Add your pasta and cook according to package directions, or until just al dente. Remember to reserve your pasta water (I just scoop a bunch out with a large mug or heat-safe glass measuring cup!) Drain pasta, and quickly pour it back into the pan with the bacon fat. Quickly add the egg-parmesan mixture and a splash of pasta water (start with 1/4 cup) and working quickly, using tongs, toss the pasta, to combine it with the mixture to create a creamy "sauce". Add the remaining 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese and keep tossing until melted and combined. Add a splash or so more of the pasta water (up to the remaining ¼ cup) if it seems like it needs more moisture. Season with freshly cracked black pepper. You most likely won't need any salt since bacon and parmesan are salty enough on their own! Add chopped fresh parsley and toss once more. Top with the crispy mushrooms. Serve immediately with extra grated parmesan and fresh basil.

Glazed Lemon, Yogurt, and Olive Oil Pound Cake Recipe | Sur La Table	Home /Recipes/Desserts/Cakes & Custards/Glazed Lemon, Yogurt, and Olive Oil Pound Cake	By Aran Goyoaga	MAKES 1 LOAF	 For the cake  1 cup (200 g) sugar 1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest (from 2 to 3 medium lemons)  1 cup (140 g) superfine brown rice flour 1 cup (100 g) almond flour, any lumps broken up 3 large eggs ½ cup (115 g) whole-milk yogurt or Cashew-Coconut Yogurt  ½ cup (110 g) extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 1 tablespoon baking powder ½ teaspoon kosher salt    For the glaze  2 cups (240 g) powdered sugar 2 to 3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 2 tablespoons finely chopped pistachios, for topping  	This is the basic snack cake of my childhood. I would come home from school to find it displayed on an old red melamine tray cooling on the outdoor balcony. It is very lemony and moist with a simple glaze. You can add orange zest or poppy seeds to it if you&#8217;d like.  1.    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease the inside of an 8½-by-4½-inch loaf pan with a little bit of olive oil.  2.    To make the cake, in a large bowl, rub together the sugar and lemon zest until fragrant. This helps release the natural lemon oil. Whisk in the remaining ingredients until the batter is smooth. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 45 to 50 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cake cool in the pan for 15 minutes, then invert onto a wire rack. Let the cake cool completely if you want the glaze to stay thick on top of the cake. If the cake is warm, the glaze will melt and run off.  3.    To make the glaze, in a medium bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar and lemon juice until smooth and lump free. As you begin to whisk, it might seem too thick, but as the sugar absorbs the juice, the glaze will thin out. The glaze should be pourable but not too runny.   4.    Put a tray or baking sheet under the wire rack and pour the glaze all over the cake, letting it run over the edges. Wait a few minutes for the glaze to set. Sprinkle the top with the pistachios, then serve. The cake will keep at room temperature for 3 days. If you refrigerate it, the glaze will soften.  &#169;2021 by Aran Goyoaga.

To prepare the baking dishes: Grease an 8 inch baking pan and line with parchment paper that overhangs from two edges of the pan. You will use the paper to help you remove brownies from the dish when baked.     To prepare the chocolate: Place butter and chocolate in a medium saucepan and place over low heat, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until melted. Remove the saucepan from the heat and cool slightly.     To prepare the egg mixture: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together sugar, eggs, and vanilla until the mixture is pale and fluffy, about 2 minutes.     To prepare the batter: Pour the melted chocolate into the egg mixture, whisking to combine. Use a silicone spatula to mix the flour and salt into the batter.     To bake: Pour the mixture into the prepared pan, transfer to the oven and bake until the brownies are just set, and the center is slightly gooey, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool completely, remove from the pan, and cut into 16, 2-inch squares.    To prepare the glaze: Add chocolate chips to a heatproof bowl. To a small saucepan set over medium heat, add cream and bring to a simmer. Pour cream over chocolate and allow to stand for 5 minutes. Whisk chocolate and cream together until fully melted and combine; allow to sit for about 10 minutes to set up slightly.    Pour the melted white chocolate into a disposable piping bag.    To assemble: Dip the flat side (bottom side) of each brownie square into chocolate glaze. Set the brownie, glazed side up, on a plate. Cut off a small tip of disposable piping bag with white chocolate. Working with one brownie at a time, pipe white chocolate over the glaze in a spiral, starting from the center and moving toward the edge. Use a wooden skewer or a toothpick to drag the white chocolate from the center towards the edge, creating the spider web design. Clean the tip of the skewer each time you drag it through chocolate for a clean look. Repeat with remaining brownies, glaze, and chocolate. Refrigerate brownies until setup.

To the flat side place about 2 tablespoons of frosting and using an offset spatula spread into an even layer. Repeat with the remaining flat-side up cakes.  Transfer remaining frosting into a piping bag fitted with a medium-small open round tip. Pipe and decorate the dome-side up cakes as desired.  Place the decorated cake on top of its matched frosted bottom and press gently to adhere the sides together. Serve immediately, or place in an airtight food storage container and refrigerate for up to 1 week.  Decorating ideas: Pipe sweet words such as; Sweet, Sweetheart, and Love onto top cake. Pipe people’s names on to top cake. Pipe hearts, dots, or flowers onto top cake. Dust a plain top with confectioners’ sugar.	
SPINACH TAGLIATELLE Recipe | Sur La Table	Home /Recipes/Main Courses/Grains, Legumes & Pasta/SPINACH TAGLIATELLE	By Tested and perfected in the Sur La Table kitchen	2-3 servings	  3 ounces spinach, washed and trimmed 1/2 teaspoon fine kosher salt, plus more for salting water 1 large egg 1 large egg yolk 1 1/4 cups (6 1/4 ounces) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting Semolina flour, for dusting pasta and surfaces   	Tagliatelle, pappardelle, tagliolini are just a few of our favorite hand-cut ribbon pasta. The only difference between the shapes is the width in which it is cut. Tagliatelle, meaning “cut” in Italian, is cut to 1/3-inch, pappardelle to 3/4-inch and tagliolini to 1/8-inch. The general rule of thumb for the sauce is the wider the ribbon, the heavier the sauce.   1. To blanch spinach:   Fill a large pot of water and bring to a rolling boil. Generously salt water. Add spinach to boiling water and cook until tender, about 30 seconds. Using tongs, transfer spinach to a colander and rinse under cold water. Thoroughly spin dry spinach in a salad spinner or wring dry in a clean kitchen towel.  2. To prepare dough: To the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade, purée spinach. Add eggs and yolk to purée and process until well combined. Add flour and 1/2 teaspoon of salt and process until dough comes together, about 20 seconds.  3. Transfer dough to well-floured surface. Knead dough until it is smooth and flexible but not sticky, adding small amounts of flour as needed, 6 to 8 minutes. Gather dough into a ball and flatten into a disk. Cover in plastic wrap and allow dough to rest for at least 10 minutes and up to 1 hour at room temperature.  4. To roll out and cut dough:  Secure a pasta machine to edge of a long countertop. Using a bench scraper, cut dough into 2 pieces. Keep extra dough covered in plastic wrap while working with one piece. With a rolling pin or your hand, roll or flatten dough into a rough rectangle that will fit inside widest setting of pasta machine. Roll dough through machine, catching it with one hand as you roll with other. Take dough and trifold it like a letter. Turn dough so one open end faces machine and roll it through on widest setting again. Fold, turn and roll once more on the widest setting.   5. Continue rolling pasta through machine without folding, adjusting rollers to a smaller setting each time. Roll out each sheet to second to last thinnest setting. If pasta sheet becomes too large to handle, use a bench scraper to cut it into more manageable lengths and continue rolling.   6. To shape the tagliatelle:  Liberally flour one sheet of pasta and loosely roll it into a cylinder. Using a sharp knife, cut roll into 1/3" ribbons. Unwrap ribbons, toss them with semolina flour and form into piles on baking sheets dusted with semolina. The pasta can be cooked immediately or covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 24 hours before use.   7. To cook the pasta: To a large pot of water set over high heat, add water to 2/3 full and bring to a boil. Generously season water with salt. Add pasta and stir immediately to prevent tagliatelle from sticking together. Boil until al dente, 2 to 3 minutes. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water and drain pasta through a colander. Use reserved pasta water to thin your chosen pasta sauce.

Focaccia Ligure Recipe | Sur La Table	Home /Recipes/Breads/Yeast Breads/Focaccia Ligure	By Academia Barilla, adapted by the Sur La Table kitchen	Makes 10 servings	  17½ oz (500g) water, warm (105°F to 115°F) 1 oz (30g) quick rise yeast 1 tablespoon (15g) barley malt or sugar 2 pounds (900g) Caputo 00 Pizza Flour &#8531; cup (100g) boiled mashed potatoes 1 tablespoon (25g) salt 3½ oz (100g) Extra Virgin Olive Oil Riviera Ligure DOP Academia Barilla  For the preparation of the solution: ½ cup water 1 tablespoon salt &#8531;  cup (for 21 oz. of dough) Extra Virgin Olive Oil Riviera Ligure DOP Academia Barilla 4 teaspoons Sapori Italiani Academia Barilla, to taste  	Focaccia is a popular Italian yeast bread which is sometimes compared to pizza, as they are both are flat breads. The focus of focaccia, however, is on the bread, rather than the toppings, although toppings for focaccia are almost as diverse as those on pizza.   The top of the focaccia is dimpled and brushed with oil to keep the bread moist and flavorful. The dimpling in the dough is usually accomplished by poking it gently with the fingers just before dressing the bread. The dimples collect oil and any added herbs and spices&#8212;creating pockets of flavor. A well-made focaccia should feel light and flavorful, not greasy and heavy.  In Italy, flour is classified either as 1, 0, or 00, and refers to how finely ground the flour is, and how much of the bran and germ have been removed.

Greek Yogurt Recipe | Sur La Table	Home /Recipes/Desserts/Ice Cream, Yogurt & Sorbets/Greek Yogurt	By Fagor		 You only need two ingredients to make yogurt at home: any type of milk and plain store-bought yogurt (with live active cultures) or starter yogurt.    Choosing the Milk &#8212; The following types of milk may be used:  Pasteurized milk of any fat content (full, 2%, 1% or skim milk)  Powdered milk  Long-life UHT sterilized milk  Soy Milk (Be sure to use UHT soy milk, which contains one of the following ingredients: fructose, honey or malt. These ingredients are necessary for fermentation and you will not succeed if none are available in the milk.)  Live Active Cultures-Unflavored Yogurt (All you need is a small amount of plain, unflavored yogurt with live active cultures, often called probiotics. The plain yogurt can either be purchased from a store or used from a previous batch of homemade yogurt.)  NOTE: For 5 cups of milk use ½ cup of plain yogurt or 1 packet starter culture. For 1 cup of milk use about one tablespoon of plain yogurt.   	Yogurt Making Process:  Take the starter yogurt from the refrigerator so that it has time to come to room temperature while you heat the milk.   Place the desired amount of milk in the removable cooking pot. Leave the lid off and heat the milk to 180-185°F by pressing the SLOW COOK LOW function. Use a thermometer to make sure that proper temperature has been reached.   Remove the removable cooking pot from heat and allow the milk to cool to lukewarm (100°F-110°F). To accelerate the cooling down process, place the removable cooking pot in cold water. Do not let it cool below 90°F.   Stir in the plain yogurt or starter culture packet and use a silicone whisk (metal will scratch cooking pot) to mix it with the milk until the consistency is smooth with no lumps remaining.  Place the lid on the Multi-cooker; align the handle with the condensation collector (open lock symbol), and turn it counterclockwise until the locking pin clicks into place. Turn the pressure regulator knob to STEAM when using the yogurt program. Press the YOGURT button. The preset cooking time is 8 hours. Depending on the flavor of yogurt you like best, you can choose how long to cook the yogurt for by pressing the + or - button. With longer cooking time, the yogurt will have a more tart flavor. With shorter time, the yogurt will have a milder flavor.   Press the START/STOP button to begin the yogurt function. The unit will begin to count down in 1 minute increments once the correct temperature has been reached.   When the yogurt is ready, remove the lid. There may be some yellowish liquid, whey, on top of the yogurt. This is normal, whey contains nutrients and protein. Mix it back into the yogurt.   If you prefer regular yogurt, cover and place in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours before serving, or until yogurt cools down. If you prefer Greek yogurt, continue reading.    Greek Yogurt: Place the strainer or a cheese cloth inside a container so the strainer doesn&#8217;t touch the bottom of the container to allow for better drainage.   Pour the homemade yogurt into the strainer or cheese cloth and cover with the lid. Put it in the refrigerator to strain and chill for at least 2 hours. The longer the time, the thicker the yogurt becomes.   Gently remove yogurt from strainer or cheese cloth by turning the strainer or cheese cloth upside down on a plate or container.   Put it back in the refrigerator to chill for another few hours before serving.

Grilled Garlic-Rubbed Lamb Chops Recipe | Sur La Table	Home /Recipes/Main Courses/Meat/Grilled Garlic-Rubbed Lamb Chops	By Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes	Makes 8 appetizer servings	  3 racks (8 ribs each) Frenched lamb racks, trimmed of excess fat Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper  8 garlic cloves, peeled 1 bunch Italian flat-leaf parsley, stems removed, plus more for garnish 3 large sprigs rosemary, leaves removed, stems discarded ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil  Vegetable or canola oil, for brushing grates Juice of 1 lemon  	 Serve these succulent grilled lamb chops as a luxurious appetizer or a delicious main course. Look for Frenched racks, which are lamb racks with the fat and membranes removed from the tops of the bones. If you want to prepare this dish for a crowd, take a tip from restaurant chefs and quickly sear the chops on the grill to mark them. Once your guests arrive, finish roasting the chops in a preheated 400°F oven to make getting them to the table on time easier.  Using a sharp slicing knife, cut the lamb racks into individual chops. Place on a rimmed baking sheet and season on all sides with salt and pepper.  In the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade, place garlic, parsley, and rosemary and process using pulses until roughly chopped. With machine running, drizzle in olive oil to form a coarse paste. Remove the garlic and herb paste from the food processor and rub all over the lamb chops. Cover chops with plastic wrap and marinate at room temperature for 30 to 60 minutes.  Prepare a hot charcoal fire, preheat a gas grill to medium-high, or heat a large grill pan over medium-high heat. Coat grill grates or grill pan with a thin coating of oil. Place the lamb chops on the grill and cook for 4 to 5 minutes. Using tongs, turn the chops and cook to medium rare, 3 to 4 minutes longer. If chops are browning too quickly, move them to a cooler spot on the grill. Alternately, transfer them to a rack set over a rimmed baking sheet and roast in a preheated 400°F oven to finish cooking.  To serve, place chops on a serving platter and sprinkle with lemon juice. Garnish with additional parsley leaves and serve immediately.

Chicken Tagine with Apricots and Almonds Recipe | Sur La Table	Home /Recipes/Main Courses/Poultry/Chicken Tagine with Apricots and Almonds	By Sur La Table & Ren&eacute;e Behnke, Memorable Recipes	Makes 6 servings	  <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 2 teaspoons ground ginger 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon ground turmeric 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, each cut into thirds 3 tablespoons olive oil 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 large yellow onion, chopped 1 large red bell pepper, cored, seeded, and chopped 6 cloves garlic, pressed or minced 1 tablespoon finely chopped shallot 1 cup chicken stock or top-quality chicken broth <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> teaspoon saffron threads 5 sprigs fresh flat-leaf parsley 5 sprigs fresh cilantro 2 &#8531; cups water 1 cup dried apricots, each halved <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup honey 2 cinnamon sticks 2 cups couscous <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup toasted blanched whole almonds  	This tagine is an ideal example of Morocco&#8217;s vibrant cuisine: chicken braised with warm spices, dried apricots, honey, and vegetables in a stew of incomparable fragrance and flavor. I prefer to use chicken thigh meat; the darker meat stays moist and tender when simmered. You can use chicken breast pieces if you prefer, but avoid overcooking.  Stir together the flour, cinnamon, ginger, salt, cumin, turmeric, and pepper in a large bowl. In batches, add the chicken and toss well to evenly coat.  Heat the oil and butter in a deep saut&eacute; pan over medium heat. Working in batches, brown the chicken pieces for a few minutes on each side and transfer to a plate. Set aside.  Add the onion, bell pepper, garlic, and shallot to the pan and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, until just beginning to soften. Return the chicken to the pan with the chicken stock and saffron. Tie together the parsley and cilantro sprigs with kitchen string and add to the pan. Cover and cook over medium-low heat for about 30 minutes, until the chicken is tender and cooked through. (The liquids should simmer gently, not boil; decrease the heat if needed.)  While the chicken is cooking, combine 1 cup of the water with the apricots, honey, and cinnamon sticks in a small saucepan. Bring just to a boil over medium-high heat. Decrease the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for about 25 minutes, or until the apricots are plump and the liquid is reduced to a thick glaze.  Add the apricot mixture to the chicken and continue simmering for 10 minutes. Check for seasoning, adding more salt or pepper to taste. Discard the cinnamon sticks and herb bundle.  Place the couscous in a medium heatproof bowl. Bring the remaining 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> cups water to a boil, pour over the couscous, and stir to mix. Cover the bowl with foil to seal securely and set aside for 5 minutes. Fluff the couscous with a fork and spoon it onto individual plates. Top the couscous with the chicken mixture. Scatter the almonds over and serve.  	
Goat Cheese Tortellini with Pancetta, Sweet Peas, and Mint Recipe | Sur La Table	Home /Recipes/Main Courses/Grains, Legumes & Pasta/Goat Cheese Tortellini with Pancetta, Sweet Peas, and Mint	By Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen	Makes 4 servings	  Filling:  ½ cup whole milk ricotta cheese, strained (see instructions below)  ¼ cup fresh goat cheese 2 teaspoons lemon zest 2 tablespoons Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, grated 1 large egg, lightly beaten ¼ teaspoon kosher salt  ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper  1 recipe <a href="https://www.surlatable.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-SLT-Site/default/Product-RecipeShow?pid=REC-273505&cgid=#prefn1=productType&prefv1=HardGood&q=fresh%20pasta%20dough&start=1" target="_blank">Fresh Pasta Dough»</a>  Semolina flour for dusting   Tortellini:  ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil, more as needed 8 ounces pancetta, finely diced  1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1 large shallot, minced  2 medium garlic cloves, minced 1 ½ cups shelled fresh peas, or frozen if fresh is unavailable, thawed  Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper  1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice  20 fresh mint leaves, cut into ribbons ½ cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, grated, plus more for serving  	Fresh tortellini seem complicated to make, but by following a simple folding procedure and spending a little extra time, you can have delicious fresh tortellini! If you want to stock up, freeze tortellini in a single layer, then transfer to sealable bags for long-term storage.      To make the filling:  Strain ricotta in a fine-mesh sieve over a medium bowl for at least 1 hour to remove excess liquid. Transfer ricotta to a medium bowl, add goat cheese, lemon zest, Parmigiano-Reggiano, egg, salt, and pepper; using a silicone spatula, fold to combine and set aside.   To prepare the pasta:   Roll fresh pasta out into paper-thin sheets. Use a 3-inch pastry cutter to make rounds, dust the tops of the pasta rounds with flour and cover loosely with a clean kitchen towel or a piece of plastic wrap. Repeat until all the pasta dough is used. (You can gather the pasta scraps and reroll them to make more rounds, as long as they are still soft and workable.)   Fill and shape the tortellini:   Gather pasta rounds, the filling, a baking sheet coated with flour and a small bowl of water together next to a clean workspace. Line up 3 pasta rounds and place 1 teaspoon of filling in the center of each. Dip your finger in the bowl of water and run it along the edge of the round to moisten. Fold the dough over to form a half moon and press to seal. Next, draw the two corners together to form a rounded bonnet shape, and press the ends tightly together to seal. Place the tortellini on the floured baking sheet and repeat with remaining pasta rounds and filling.   To prepare the sauce:  To a large skillet over medium-high heat, add olive oil. When oil is shimmering, add pancetta and cook until crispy, about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer pancetta to a paper towel-lined plate. Reduce heat to medium and discard all but 2 tablespoons of fat from the skillet. Add butter, shallot, and garlic and cook until soft and translucent, about 2 minutes. If using fresh peas, add peas and ½ cup hot water. Stir well and simmer until peas are bright green and tender, about 1 minute. (Omit water if using previously frozen peas.)  Remove pan from heat; taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Set aside while preparing tortellini.   To cook the tortellini:   Heat a large pot of water over high heat until boiling. Generously season water with salt. Add tortellini and stir gently to prevent pasta from sticking together. Boil until the tortellini rise to the top of the water and filling is hot and cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes.   Reserve about a cup of pasta water and use a fine-mesh sieve to transfer hot tortellini to skillet with sauce. Gently toss the pasta with the sauce, adding the reserved pasta water as needed to thin the sauce. Add crispy pancetta and lemon juice and gently toss to combine. (Don&#8217;t toss too much, or pasta will break apart.)  To serve:   Taste and adjust seasoning with salt, pepper, and lemon juice. Divide tortellini among pasta bowls. Garnish with mint leaves, grated cheese, and freshly ground pepper; serve immediately.

Ultimate Pumpkin Pie with Rum Whipped Cream Recipe | Sur La Table	Home /Recipes/Desserts/Pies, Pastries & Tarts/Ultimate Pumpkin Pie with Rum Whipped Cream	By Ina Garten, Barefoot Contessa Foolproof	Makes 8 to 10 servings	  Filling: 1 (15-ounce) can pumpkin pur&#233;e (not pie filling)  ½ cup light brown sugar, lightly packed ¼ cup granulated sugar ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon ¼ teaspoon ground ginger ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg ½ teaspoon Kosher salt 2 teaspoons grated orange zest 3 extra-large eggs, lightly beaten 1 cup heavy cream ½ cup whole milk 2 tablespoons dark rum, such as Mount Gay Dried beans, for blind baking  Rum Whipped Cream: 1 cup cold heavy cream 3 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon mascarpone or cr&#232;me fra&#238;che 1 tablespoon good dark rum, such as Mount Gay 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract  Perfect Pie Crust: yields 2 (9- to 11-inch crusts) 12 tablespoons (1½ sticks) very cold unsalted butter 3 cups all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon sugar 1 teaspoon Kosher salt &#8531; cup very cold vegetable shortening, such as Crisco ½ cup ice water  	Pumpkin pie can be boring and dense so I set out to make a better pumpkin pie. Pumpkin has a distinct squash flavor that you want to enhance without overpowering it. I’ve filled the prebaked crust with a lightly spiced pumpkin mixture that tastes more like a mousse than a dense custard. Dark rum and grated orange zest are my secret ingredients. - Ina Garten  Prepare the pie crust: Cut the butter in ½-inch dice and return it to the refrigerator while you prepare the flour mixture. Place the flour, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade and pulse a few times to mix. Add the butter and shortening. Pulse 8 to 12 times, until the butter is the size of peas. With the machine running, pour the ice water down the feed tube and pulse the machine until the dough begins to form a ball. Dump out onto a floured board and roll into a ball. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.  Cut the dough in half. Roll each piece on a well-floured board into a circle at least 1 inch larger than the pie pan, rolling from the center to the edge, turning and flouring the dough so it doesn&#8217;t stick to the board. (You should see bits of butter in the dough.) Fold the dough in half, ease it into the pie pan without stretching at all, and unfold to fit the pan. With a small sharp paring knife, cut the dough 1 inch larger around than the pan. Fold the edge under and crimp the edge with either your fingers or the tines of a fork.  NOTE: Store the shortening in the refrigerator so it&#8217;s always cold. You can store the prepared pie crust in the fridge for up to a day.  Make the pie: Preheat the oven to 425°F.  Line an 11-inch pie pan with the unbaked pie crust and place it on a sheet pan. Line the crust with parchment paper. Fill the paper &#190; full with the beans and bake the crust for 15 minutes, until the edges start to brown. Remove the beans and paper (save the beans for another time), prick the crust all over with the tines of a fork, and bake for another 5 minutes.  Reduce the oven temperature to 350°F.  Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together the pumpkin, brown sugar, granulated sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, salt, orange zest, eggs, cream, milk and rum. Pour the filling into the baked pie shell.  Bake for 55 to 65 minutes, until the filling is just set in the middle and a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Set aside to cool completely. Serve with the rum whipped cream.  Rum Whipped Cream: Place the cream in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat on medium speed for 1 minute. Add the sugar, mascarpone, rum and vanilla. Beat on medium-high until it forms soft peaks. Serve with the pumpkin pie.  NOTE: If you overwhip the cream and it looks curdled, just add a little more cream and whip it until it forms soft peaks.
